changelog
        version 0.99.4
                - vignette updates


This package depends on Open Babel 2.3.1 or greater. On linux and mac it can be compiled 
and run against the standard shared library version of Open Babel. On windows, the distributed
binary has been compiled agains a static version of Open Babel 2.3.2. This was done because the 
version downloadable from the Open Babel website was compiled with MSVC and is not 
compatible with GNU based toolchain used by BioConductor. This means that on  windows
there is no need to install Open Babel seperataly, but also that Open Babel cannot be 
updated outside of the ChemmineOB package. If you need to compile ChemmineOB from source
on windows you can follow the instructions below.

Compling with OpenBabel in a non-standard location
---------------------------------------------------
If the OpenBabel include and/or library files are not in one of the default
search paths (e.g., /usr/lib,/usr/include, /usr/local/lib,/usr/local/include), then you must set the
following environment variables before installing the ChemmineOB package:

OPEN_BABEL_INCDIR = path to header files
OPEN_BABEL_LIBDIR = path to shared (.so) library file

Compiling on Windows
---------------------

Set up directory structure like this:

C:\openbabel_src
    \i386
     \x64

c:\openbabel
     \i386
      \x64

c:\openbabel_build
     \i386
     \x64

Download the openbabel source and copy it into both c:\openbabel_src\i386 and c:\openbabel_src\x64.

Set up the following global environment variables: in control panel/system:

D:\sandbox\ChemmineOB\src>echo %OPEN_BABEL_SRC%
c:/openbabel_src

D:\sandbox\ChemmineOB\src>echo %OPEN_BABEL_BIN%
c:/openbabel

Install the zlibbioc package. In R, do this:
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("zlibbioc")

Get the location of the zlib includes as follows (in R):
> library(zlibbioc)
> pkgconfig("PKG_CFLAGS")
That will print out something like:
-I"D:/biocbld/bbs-2.13-bioc/R/library/zlibbioc/include"
Get rid of the -I and the quotes and there is your ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR

Then get the location of the zlib library as follows:
> pkgconfig("PKG_LIBS_shared")
That will print out something like:
-L"D:/biocbld/bbs-2.13-bioc/R/library/zlibbioc/libs/i386" -lzlib1bioc>
Get rid of the -L, the quotes, and the -lzlibbioc> and append /zlib1bioc.dll
and now you have ZLIB_LIBRARY


Then compile with cmake:

cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DBUILD_SHARED=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=c:/openbabel/i386 -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR=D:/biocbld/bbs-2.13-bioc/R/library/zlibbioc/include -DZLIB_LIBRARY=D:/biocbld/bbs-2.13-bioc/R/library/zlibbioc/libs/i386/zlib1bioc.dll c:/openbabel_src/i386

You can run this from c:/openbabel_build/i386
Then:
make
make install
