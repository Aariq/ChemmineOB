	ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Scripting languages such as Python are ideally suited to common programming tasks in cheminformatics such as data analysis and parsing
		information from files. However, for reasons of efficiency, cheminformatics toolkits such as the OpenBabel toolkit are often implemented in compiled
			languages such as C++. We describe Pybel, a Python module that provides access to the OpenBabel toolkit.RESULTS:Pybel wraps the direct toolkit bindings
			to simplify common tasks such as reading and writing molecular files and calculating fingerprints. Extensive use is made of Python iterators to simplify
			loops such as that over all the molecules in a file. A Pybel Molecule can be easily interconverted to an OpenBabel OBMol to access those methods or
			attributes not wrapped by Pybel.CONCLUSION:Pybel allows cheminformaticians to rapidly develop Python scripts that manipulate chemical information. It is
			open source, available cross-platform, and offers the power of the OpenBabel toolkit to Python programmers.},

	ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:A frequent problem in computational modeling is the interconversion of chemical structures between different formats. While standard
		interchange formats exist (for example, Chemical Markup Language) and de facto standards have arisen (for example, SMILES format), the need to interconvert
			formats is a continuing problem due to the multitude of different application areas for chemistry data, differences in the data stored by different
			formats (0D versus 3D, for example), and competition between software along with a lack of vendor-neutral formats.RESULTS:We discuss, for the first
			time, Open Babel, an open-source chemical toolbox that speaks the many languages of chemical data. Open Babel version 2.3 interconverts over 110
			formats. The need to represent such a wide variety of chemical and molecular data requires a library that implements a wide range of cheminformatics
			algorithms, from partial charge assignment and aromaticity detection, to bond order perception and canonicalization. We detail the implementation of
			Open Babel, describe key advances in the 2.3 release, and outline a variety of uses both in terms of software products and scientific research,
		including applications far beyond simple format interconversion.CONCLUSIONS:Open Babel presents a solution to the proliferation of multiple chemical file
			formats. In addition, it provides a variety of useful utilities from conformer searching and 2D depiction, to filtering, batch conversion, and
			substructure and similarity searching. For developers, it can be used as a programming library to handle chemical data in areas such as organic
			chemistry, drug design, materials science, and computational chemistry. It is freely available under an open-source license from http://openbabel.org
